00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:14,632
The first time I saw the lamp, it stood tall and regal in my grandmother's parlor. The glass sphere caught the light, glowing like a captured star. My grandmother believed it was a family heirloom.

2
00:00:14,632 --> 00:00:28,265
My grandmother had always been difficult; impeccably groomed with an air of authority and an unnatural glow to her skin. She considered me her golden child, but our relationship soured over time.

3
00:00:28,265 --> 00:00:35,765
She died suddenly, leaving behind her vast fortune and the house she cherished so much.

4
00:00:35,765 --> 00:00:42,765
I inherited everything, including her lamp, which became a symbol of our complicated past.

5
00:00:42,765 --> 00:00:56,870
I could not bear to part with the house or the lamp, despite needing to sell both for financial reasons. The lamp's golden glow felt oppressive in my apartment, leading to migraines and nightmares.

6
00:00:56,870 --> 00:01:10,975
My return to the grandmother's house led me to notice that something was amiss: new glass panels displayed images of prosperity marred by hardship, hinting at a pact sealed long ago between our families concerning the forest dwellers.

7
00:01:10,975 --> 00:01:25,080
The lamp's story slowly unraveled, revealing a darker truth. The family fortune wasn't a gift but rather part of an old contract binding us to provide a daughter in marriage to those dwelling beneath the trees.

8
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:39,185
I discovered I was meant for such a union due to my breakage with the house and our lineage's prosperity. My grandmother had withered away without protection, and her life was offered as recompense.

9
00:01:39,185 --> 00:01:52,185
The glass changed again, reflecting the changing fortunes of our family through generations. The final image showed a waiting figure in the forest, familiar yet terrifying.

10
00:01:52,185 --> 00:02:03,685
This revelation led me to consider seeking help from those dwelling beneath the trees, even though such an approach felt unnatural for me.

11
00:02:03,685 --> 00:02:17,966
Despite my fears, venturing into the woods or facing the fae might be necessary to break this ancient contract and escape the curse that haunts our family. I hid as best I could while seeking a way out of this situation, praying the family's treachery would pass me by. The first time I saw the lamp, I was six years old. It stood tall and regal in my grandmother's parlor, catching the light through a glass sphere like a captured star. The lamp always seemed alive and gentle in her house.

12
00:02:17,966 --> 00:02:25,966
My grandmother had laughed and told me it was a family heirloom passed down through generations.

13
00:02:25,966 --> 00:02:40,579
Despite her sharp demeanor and high expectations, she was impeccably groomed and carried herself with authority. Though time creased her skin, she retained an unnatural glow compared to others her age. She never got sick and held over the rest of the family in health.

14
00:02:40,579 --> 00:02:52,079
I was her favorite, paraded before the rest with pride. She believed I had something special inside me - a spark or promise.

15
00:02:52,079 --> 00:03:06,874
Back then, I didn't question this treatment; I basked in her warmth, gifts, and praises that set me apart from cousins. But things changed as I grew up: mistakes were made (a tattoo, failed class, caught smoking), leading to her emotional withdrawal. By my twenties, we barely spoke.

16
00:03:06,874 --> 00:03:21,669
She died suddenly of an unknown illness that baffled doctors. Everything went to me in her will, although my relatives resented it. I let them have the money but kept the house and its history.

17
00:03:21,669 --> 00:03:36,465
I couldn't bear to part with the house, feeling at home there more than anywhere else. The lamp was a piece of her to keep as I faced selling the estate. It stood unchanged where I remembered it - pristine and mysterious in its gilded iron frame, supporting an ornate glass sphere holding luminous hues telling tales.

18
00:03:36,465 --> 00:03:51,260
However, getting the lamp out proved difficult due to its delicate nature. My ex-boyfriend helped me, though we hadn't spoken much since the breakup. In my small apartment, the light was oppressive; I felt migraines and blamed the lamp for my unease before eventually hiding it in my closet.

19
00:03:51,260 --> 00:04:06,055
Nightmares followed with dreams of his car crash death, leaving me gasping and frantic. Complications arose when trying to sell the house or find a new place; instead, I returned to the estate as if drawn by an unseen force. The lamp now cast its glow, but something was off - there was new glass with images.

20
00:04:06,055 --> 00:04:20,851
My family's fortune wasn't luck but a cost-heavy contract binding us to ancient forces. They required balance through generations; my ancestors once stepped into woods for marriage pacts. I had broken this bond unintentionally and felt responsible for their suffering in return for my well-being.

21
00:04:20,851 --> 00:04:33,351
The lamp, once telling stories of hope and sacrifice, now revealed darker tales. Celebrations disappeared except for the forest image with familiar figures in shadow.

22
00:04:33,351 --> 00:04:48,376
I knew from deep certainty that these woods were somewhere I'd been before - a place filled with golden light where something awaited me. It felt familiar yet terrifying; an ominous presence lingered between the trees.

23
00:04:48,376 --> 00:05:03,401
I dreamed of wandering barefoot into this damp earth, chased by a figure in shadows that was eerily familiar. My waking reality involved migraines and the forest's pull on my psyche.

24
00:05:03,401 --> 00:05:18,426
The realization came that I had once wandered in these woods with my grandmother, escaping unnoticed at five years old. I remembered cool earth beneath my feet, the rich scent of greenery, laughter fading into nothingness. The voice calling my name now linked to her words about something special within me - a spark or promise.

25
00:05:18,426 --> 00:05:33,451
It became evident the lamp had been telling tales of suffering and debt unpaid all along. My family's wealth, health, prosperity came at great cost through generations: a bride promised to maintain balance with the force dwelling beneath trees. I unintentionally broke this bond by leaving instead of fulfilling my destiny as some ancestors once did.

26
00:05:33,451 --> 00:05:46,951
The glass in the lamp shifted again; fields vanished from its imagery but the forest remained, and within it stood a shadowed figure demanding what was owed.

27
00:05:46,951 --> 00:06:02,280
I couldn't shake off the feeling that I had stepped into their woods before or belonged to them somehow. Deep down, something whispered I would see this place again. It haunted me in my sleep.

28
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:17,610
The nightmares brought clarity of an impending reckoning: the forest waited for its due from the bond broken long ago by those who strayed too far. Everything clicked - my family's misfortune paralleled with mine and that of my grandmother.

29
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:32,940
The glass panel at the lamp changed once more, reflecting a scene filled with golden light and vibrant flowers but devoid of people except two clasped hands between figures separated by some distance - familiar faces suggesting kinship to me. This tableau hinted at destiny or purpose I had yet to fulfill despite being unable to pinpoint specifics.

30
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:48,270
My mind raced for solutions to my predicaments, torn between hiding from the inevitable reckoning with the fae and attempting direct communication. However, that path filled my heart with dread while offering no assurance of success.

31
00:06:48,270 --> 00:07:03,600
Simultaneously, I prayed I could find a way out of this mess as I tried to keep my wits about me in an increasingly desperate situation.
