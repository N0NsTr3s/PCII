1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,632
Ethan first saw them on a lonely stretch of road just past dusk.

2
00:00:04,632 --> 00:00:13,248
At first, they looked like nothing more than shadows—cattle standing stiff on the ridge, a lone figure in a wide-brimmed hat among them.

3
00:00:13,248 --> 00:00:15,624
But then he saw their eyes.

4
00:00:15,624 --> 00:00:17,040
Glowing.

5
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:18,528
Watching.

6
00:00:18,528 --> 00:00:19,944
Waiting.

7
00:00:19,944 --> 00:00:23,112
An icy shiver crawled up his spine.

8
00:00:23,112 --> 00:00:28,632
He told himself it was just a trick of the light, just the way the sun caught their eyes.

9
00:00:28,632 --> 00:00:36,840
But something deep in his gut told him to drive faster, to put as much distance between himself and that field as possible.

10
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,592
Yet, no matter how fast he went, the feeling followed him home.

11
00:00:41,592 --> 00:00:47,904
That night, he lay in bed, staring at the ceiling, unable to shake the image of those eyes.

12
00:00:47,904 --> 00:00:54,072
The way they hadn’t just reflected the light, but burned with something deeper—something alive.

13
00:00:54,072 --> 00:00:56,304
Then he realized something.

14
00:00:56,304 --> 00:00:59,856
The glowing eyes hadn’t been in his rearview mirror.

15
00:00:59,856 --> 00:01:02,832
They had been reflected in his windshield.

16
00:01:02,832 --> 00:01:05,712
Watching him from the passenger seat.

17
00:01:05,712 --> 00:01:07,968
Ethan barely slept.

18
00:01:07,968 --> 00:01:13,224
The next day, he went back—he had to prove to himself it was nothing.

19
00:01:13,224 --> 00:01:17,472
He pulled up to the field just as the sun dipped below the hills.

20
00:01:17,472 --> 00:01:21,504
The cattle were there, standing as still as tombstones.

21
00:01:21,504 --> 00:01:23,832
The figure was there, too.

22
00:01:23,832 --> 00:01:25,248
Waiting.

23
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:29,304
He gripped his phone and climbed over the rusted barbed wire.

24
00:01:29,304 --> 00:01:31,824
The wind whistled through the grass.

25
00:01:31,824 --> 00:01:33,768
The trees creaked.

26
00:01:33,768 --> 00:01:37,080
Somewhere, a crow let out a harsh caw.

27
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:42,168
He took a cautious step forward, lifting his phone to snap a picture.

28
00:01:42,168 --> 00:01:45,336
Then he noticed the fence post beside him.

29
00:01:45,336 --> 00:01:50,328
There was something resting on it—a skull, picked clean and grinning wide.

30
00:01:50,328 --> 00:01:52,440
Ethan’s breath hitched.

31
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,360
He spun around.

32
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,520
The cattle had moved.

33
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:00,360
They were closer now, their burning eyes fixed on him.

34
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:04,848
The figure in the hat turned its head, slow and deliberate.

35
00:02:04,848 --> 00:02:10,752
The shadows seemed to stretch and twist around it, swallowing the last light of the day.

36
00:02:10,752 --> 00:02:12,456
Ethan ran.

37
00:02:12,456 --> 00:02:18,648
He scrambled over the fence, bolted to his car, and tore down the road without looking back.

38
00:02:18,648 --> 00:02:24,984
He didn’t stop until he was home, slamming the door shut behind him, chest heaving.

39
00:02:24,984 --> 00:02:27,576
He laughed, shaking his head.

40
00:02:27,576 --> 00:02:29,856
Just his imagination.

41
00:02:29,856 --> 00:02:32,808
Just shadows and tricks of the mind.

42
00:02:32,808 --> 00:02:35,088
Then his phone buzzed.

43
00:02:35,088 --> 00:02:37,680
A new photo had been taken.

44
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,920
Hands trembling, he opened his gallery.

45
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,560
It wasn't the picture he had taken.

46
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:47,976
It wasn’t the cattle, or the field, or the figure in the hat.

47
00:02:47,976 --> 00:02:50,568
It was a photo of his bedroom.

48
00:02:50,568 --> 00:02:52,392
A photo of him.

49
00:02:52,392 --> 00:02:53,928
Asleep.

50
00:02:53,928 --> 00:03:00,000
And in the corner of the room, nearly swallowed by the darkness—

Two glowing eyes.

51
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,488
Watching.

52
00:03:01,488 --> 00:03:02,904
Waiting.
